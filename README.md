DNS + Email

DNS (Domain Name System or Server or Service) is a system used to translate domain names into IP (internet protocol) addresses in order to enable users to visit a desired website on the Internet. It is a system that takes a human friendly (aka more readable and memorable) domain name and translates it into a machine readable numerical IP address which points to a corresponding website. <br>
Email employs the Domain Name System (DNS) as well. When a user sends an email to a recipient at their email address (ex: jane@hotmail.com), the user’s email server will take the domain name of the email address (domain name being what is to the right of the “@”) and perform a DNS lookup. Once the domain has been found the server will query the domain for the MX (or mail exchange) records and look for the specific name of the MX records in DNS to get the correct IP address for the email recipient and then transfer the email data in the form of an email message.
